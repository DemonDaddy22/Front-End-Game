# SUDOKU

## By [DemonDaddy22](https://github.com/DemonDaddy22/)

- Implemented the solution in ReactJS initially
- Took about 3 hours to complete the exercise
- Majority time went in trying to persist the game in progress
- Created a simple script to convert data in a CSV file to JSON file which can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/DemonDaddy22/4ea5c4b44a8390872396f7db276d2684)
- Attached [sudoku.csv](sudoku.csv) for reference which contains about 1000 Sudoku puzzles and their solutions
