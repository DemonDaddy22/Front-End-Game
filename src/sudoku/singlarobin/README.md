# SUDOKU

## By [singlarobin](https://github.com/singlarobin/)

-   Implemented the solution in ReactJS initially
-   Took about 5 hours to complete the exercise
-   Majority time went in trying to persist the game in progress and to make the grid UI
-   Created a Sudoku Puzzle with the data coming from the API. Here is the link of rapid api that i have used for your reference - https://rapidapi.com/andrewarochukwu/api/sudoku-board/
